'RANDOM ROSES' — my personal collection of cool ITP quotes.

***

Hello! I am a grad student, currently taking Web Developement class at NYU. This is my first homework — a VERY simple webpage to get familiar with HTML, CSS, GitHub, Terminal, JavaScript, and other programming tools.

I am a writer, so I decided to make something meaningful around words. It is also a little bit personal since I consider this wepage the first [awkward] step towards a decently looking portfolio site built by myself. 

Long story short, I have a note on my laptop where I keep my favourite quotes from the Interactive Telecommunications Program (my grad school at NYU). These are random thoughts that I catch and can't let go since I feel they are sometimes way too fun, deep, and useful to forget. 

I called this page 'Random Roses' since this is cool expression I got at one of the AI guest speaking sessions.

Since at ITP we are used to document everything:

CHALLENGES 

1. Development

I still don't have a perfect workflow. I created an ssh key but still had to use GitHub desktop to upload the final version of the code to the GitHub. I also tried to add git each time I changed something but I somehow suspect my repository is far from perfect for now.

2. CSS

I am not saying 'this is a disaster!', I am just saying that it will take my time to learn it properly. I faild to get many things I wanted done at this point. I failed even at copying some ready patterns, and I think that trying to ise them actually made my code even more messy.

For instance I failed to use the roses I wanted for the background or position the text. Below is one of the awlful attempts.

I also failed to add the transparent box behind some of the text so that I could have the background I wanted.

Positioning is still a huge subject to learn for me.

Nevertheless, by googling I learned about 'weirdest CSS colors' and successfully used one of them called 'thistle'.

However, that was fun! (Okay, it wasn't but I loved it). And I definitely need to learn positioning with CSS.
